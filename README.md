___

## Welcome to the Historical Image Restoration project repository! This project is dedicated to preserving cultural heritage by restoring degraded historical photographs. Over time, these invaluable images suffer from issues like scratches, stains, fading, and discoloration, making it challenging to appreciate their historical significance.

## Our solution combines advanced image processing techniques and state-of-the-art algorithms, such as deep learning-based inpainting and enhancement, to rejuvenate these photographs while preserving their authenticity. The system is designed to be efficient, scalable, and accessible, ensuring it can handle diverse types of damage and cater to users with varying expertise levels.
